Notes from subject expert:
"In order of importance, it's something like...

Name and Description
Range, Casting Time (and Ritual), Duration (and Concentration)
Attack Type, Damage Type, and Saving Throws
School and Components
Casting Level, Classes, and Higher Level"

"Concentration is a subtype of Duration.  It means the spell ends as soon as you stop concentrating on it (i.e. you can't cast other spells)"

"Ritual means you can cast the spell without preparing it in advance; however, it takes an hour."

"the closest thing to an elemental type in D&D would actually be School"
